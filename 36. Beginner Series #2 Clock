Clock shows 'h' hours, 'm' minutes and 's' seconds after midnight.

Your task is to make 'Past' function which returns time converted to milliseconds.

Example:
past(0, 1, 1) == 61000
Input constraints: 0 <= h <= 23, 0 <= m <= 59, 0 <= s <= 59

Solution:
function past(h, m, s){
  let ms = 0
  return ms += (h*60*60*1000)+(m*60*1000)+(s*1000)
}
