Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

Patrick Feeney => P.F

Solution:
function abbrevName(name){
  let array = name.split(" ")
  let initial = `${array[0][0]}.${array[1][0]}`
  return initial.toUpperCase()
}
