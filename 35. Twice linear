Consider a sequence u where u is defined as follows:

The number u(0) = 1 is the first one in u.
For each x in u, then y = 2 * x + 1 and z = 3 * x + 1 must be in u too.
There are no other numbers in u.
Ex: u = [1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 21, 22, 27, ...]

1 gives 3 and 4, then 3 gives 7 and 10, 4 gives 9 and 13, then 7 gives 15 and 22 and so on...

Task:
Given parameter n the function dbl_linear (or dblLinear...) returns the element u(n) of the ordered (with <) sequence u (so, there are no duplicates).

Example:
dbl_linear(10) should return 22

Note:
Focus attention on efficiency

Solution:
function dblLinear(n) {
  var ai = 0, bi = 0, eq = 0;
  var sequence = [1];
  while (ai + bi < n + eq) {
    var y = 2 * sequence[ai] + 1;
    var z = 3 * sequence[bi] + 1;
    if (y < z) { sequence.push(y); ai++; }
    else if (y > z) { sequence.push(z); bi++; }
    else { sequence.push(y); ai++; bi++; eq++; }
  }
  return sequence.pop();
}
