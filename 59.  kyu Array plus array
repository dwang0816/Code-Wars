I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

Solution:

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let counter = 0
  for(let i = 0;i<arr1.length;i++){
    counter += arr1[i]
  }
  for(let i = 0;i<arr2.length;i++){
    counter += arr2[i]
  }
  return counter
}
